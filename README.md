	This project is an implementation of <Complex Network Community Detection by Local Similarity> written by Doctor Liu Xu in National University of Defense Technology published on <ACTA AUTOMATICA SINICA> December, 2011.
	I and a roomate in college -- Shawn (Xiaojian) worked together and finished this demo program.
	This is a multi-thread and event-driven prototype for the similarity measurement.
	Currently, there is an error in this program, I'll fix it ASAP!!
